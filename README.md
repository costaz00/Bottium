```js
module.exports = {
    app: {

        playing: 'by Zerio ‚ù§Ô∏è',
        global: true,
        guild: 'xxx'
    },

    opt: {
        DJ: {
            enabled: false,
            roleName: 'XXX',
            commands: []
        },
        maxVol: 100,
        leaveOnEnd: true,

        spotifyBridge: true,
        defaultvolume: 75,

- `app/playing`, the activity of the bot
- `app/global`, whether the commands will work on all servers or just one (if global they might take up to an hour to show up)
- `app/guild`, the guild the slash command will be loaded to (this only applys if global is set to false)

DJ mode configuration

- `opt/DJ/enabled`, whether the DJ mode should be activated or not 
- `opt/DJ/roleName`, the name of the DJ role to be used

- `opt/leaveOnEnd`,  if the bot will leave on finishing the queue
- `opt/loopMessage`, if the message that a music is played should be sent when it is looped
- `opt/spotifyBridge`, takes spotify songs/playlists and searches it on youtube and plays it (highly recommended)
- `opt/defaultvolume`, is the defaul volume the queue will start at
- `opt/discordPlayer`, options used by discord-player
